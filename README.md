This is a project made with:

DevFlow has (or will have), depending on the day you're looking at this:

- Global database data-fetching
- AI generated answers to questions
- Badge & Reputation System

The project is based on a course, i.e. the efforts are aimed at:

- Learning about NextJS and TypeScript

- Improve knowledge and learn best practices
- Add a unique project to my portfolio.

NOTE: The branches are the most up-to-date parts of the project!
